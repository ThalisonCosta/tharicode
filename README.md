thaã‚Šcode is a clone of Visual Studio Code built using Tauri, npm, React, and TypeScript (TSX). It aims to provide a lightweight and efficient code editor with a familiar interface for developers. The project name "thaã‚Šcode" is a combination of different elements that hold personal significance:

- "tha" represents the first three letters of my name, Thalison.
- "ã‚Š" is the hiragana letter in Japanese that can be pronounced as both "li" and "ri."
- "code" refers to the purpose of the application, being a code editor.
 
Together, these elements create the unique and meaningful name, thaã‚Šcode.
